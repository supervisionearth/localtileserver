*Need to visualize a rather large (gigabytes+) raster?* **This is for you.**

  Try it out below!

.. jupyter-execute::

  from localtileserver import TileClient, get_leaflet_tile_layer, examples
  from ipyleaflet import Map

  # Create a TileClient from a raster file
  # client = TileClient('path/to/geo.tif')
  client = examples.get_san_francisco()  # use example data

  # Create ipyleaflet TileLayer from that server
  t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(client)
  # Create ipyleaflet map, add tile layer, and display
  m = Map(center=client.center(), zoom=client.default_zoom)
  m.add_layer(t)
  m

A Python package for serving tiles from large raster files in
the `Slippy Maps standard <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames>`_
(i.e., `/zoom/x/y.png`) for visualization in Jupyter with ``ipyleaflet`` or ``folium``.

Launch a `demo <https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver-demo>`_ on MyBinder |binder|

Under the hood, this is also a Flask blueprint/application for use as a
standalone web app or in your own web deployments needing dynamic tile serving.


üåü Highlights
=============

- Launch a tile server for large geospatial images
- View local or remote* raster files with ``ipyleaflet`` or ``folium`` in Jupyter
- View rasters with CesiumJS with the built-in Flask web application
- Extract regions of interest (ROIs) interactively
- Use the example datasets to generate Digital Elevation Models

*remote raster files should be pre-tiled Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs*

‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
===========

The :class:`TileClient` class can be used to to launch a tile server in a background
thread which will serve raster imagery to a viewer (see ``ipyleaflet`` and
``folium`` examples in :ref:`user_guide`).

This tile server can efficiently deliver varying resolutions of your
raster imagery to your viewer; it helps to have pre-tiled,
`Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COG) <https://www.cogeo.org/>`_, but no wories if
not as the backing library, `large_image <https://github.com/girder/large_image>`_,
will tile and cache for you when opening the raster.

There is an included, standalone web viewer leveraging
`CesiumJS <https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/>`_ and
`GeoJS <https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/>`_.
You can use the web viewer to select and extract regions of interest from rasters.
